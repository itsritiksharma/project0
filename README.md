# Project 0
Hello! there.
if you are here it means you want to know about my work on project0.
Here I'll share a detailed instruction describing my project and what's contained in each file in my repository.

In project0 I've submitted project.html file which takes you to a website made by me using concepts of HTML, CSS, SASS and Bootstrap. This website includes my general details and also takes you to different links which shows my interests and some pass time materials I rely on.

The main styling CSS file I used in this project is variable.css which have almost all the css styling I included. I used some of my learnings from bootstrap components too like carding elements on your website, how to make your pictures round etc.

variable.css contains all the majr css styling components of this website like background image, fonts, font weight, font size used in website. This css file is made using SASS concept. The original SASS file is variable.scss with a map of variable.css.map. In variable.SCSS I incorporated concepts of SCSS variable, SCSS Inheritance.

books i read.html contains all the books I have read till now. This file includes the concept of lists(ordered and unordered) in html and also using the button component from bootstrap. The styling of this file is carried out by nesting.scss ultimately including nesting.css as stylig css file for this html file.

Movies.html is made using the concepts of flexbox from bootstrap. This file contains all the movies I have watched till now. Here, "calss="rounded"" is used to make the edges of flexbox soft(rounded). Styling for this class is done using bootstrap therefore including bootstrap is a must.

Other html files(Anime.html and Series.html) which I included in this project were made same as like Movies.html, using bootstrap and concept of flexbox.

These all files(books i read.html, Anime.html, Movies.html and Series.html) served the purpose of attaching different .html files to the website by link.

Next part of my website is "My work".  Here I used the concept of cards in bootstrap to make an link to My work.html which was made using the concept of flexbox. This file includes all the works I have done using photoshop.

At the end of thsi html site I made a table using the grid component of bootstrap.
